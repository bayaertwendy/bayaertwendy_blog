# 1.Introduction:

The **resplendent quetzal** (*Pharomachrus mocinno*, La Llave, 1832) is a bird in the Trogonidae family. This species is well known for its vibrantly colored plumage. It even figures on the Guatemala's flag, being the country's international bird.

The resplendent quetzal is classified as near threatened on the IUCN Red List because of the disappearance of its habitat (tropical forests).

# 2.Description:

*Pharomachrus mocinno* has a emerald green body and a red breast. This plumage seems ideally suited for camouflage in the canopy during rainy conditions. In fact their iridescent feathers blend remarkably well with wet and shiny green vegetation.
With his body of 15 to 16 inches (36 to 40 cm) long and his weight of about 7 to 8 ounces (210 g), it's the largest representative of the Trogoniformes order.

During mating season, the male resplendent quetzal develops a tail streamer up to three feet (1 m), being longer than the rest of the body.
