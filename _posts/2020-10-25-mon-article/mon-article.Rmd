# 1.Introduction:

The **resplendent quetzal** (*Pharomachrus mocinno*, La Llave, 1832) is a bird in the Trogonidae family. This species is well known for its vibrantly colored plumage. It even figures on the Guatemala's flag, being the country's international bird.

The resplendent quetzal is classified as near threatened on the IUCN Red List because of the disappearance of its habitat (tropical forests).

# 2.Description:

*Pharomachrus mocinno* has a emerald green body and a red breast. This plumage seems ideally suited for camouflage in the canopy during rainy conditions. In fact their iridescent feathers blend remarkably well with wet and shiny green vegetation.
With his body of 15 to 16 inches (36 to 40 cm) long and his weight of about 7 to 8 ounces (210 g), it's the largest representative of the Trogoniformes order.

During mating season, the male resplendent quetzal develops a tail streamer up to three feet (1 m), being longer than the rest of the body.

# 4.Ecology:
## Distribution and habitat:

The *P. mocinno* lives in the montane tropical forest of Middle America, from southern Mexico to western Panama.

## Feeding:

This species is omnivore with a diet composed of fruit (mostly wild avocados, other fruit of the Lauraceae family and fruit belong to the Theaceae family), insects (notably wasps, ants and larvae), lizards, and other small creatures.

# 5.Reproduction:

The breeding season takes place from March to April in Mexico, May to June in El Salvador and March to May in Guatemala.
Male and female quetzal use their powerful beaks to hollow hole nests in rotted trees over 200 feet up in the air. The female lays two or three pale blue eggs in the nest. Then, both parents take turns incubating the eggs. This incubation period lasts about 18 days.
When the eggs hatch, the parents feed the young with fruit, berries, insects, lizards, ... Young quetzals begin flying after approximately three weeks old.
